## Setup and Rules

### For the Interviewer (Practice Partner)

**Before starting, set the scene:**
- Act professional but friendly (not adversarial)
- Take notes on what the candidate says (this helps with the debrief)
- Ask follow-up questions where indicated
- Do NOT help the candidate or give hints
- Time each answer mentally (note if they go over 4 minutes)
- Maintain a neutral expression (do not nod encouragingly or frown)

**Scoring rules:**
- Score each answer immediately after the candidate finishes
- Use the 1-5 scale for each dimension
- Write brief notes on strengths and weaknesses for each answer
- Be honest -- generous scoring does not help the candidate prepare

### For the Candidate

- Treat this as a REAL interview
- Dress as you would for the actual interview
- No notes allowed (close this document)
- Take a moment to think before each answer (pausing is fine)
- If you blank on a question, say so and ask for the next one
- Answer every question with the STAR method

### Timing

```
Introduction:           5 minutes
12 Questions:          36 minutes (3 min each)
Candidate Questions:    5 minutes
