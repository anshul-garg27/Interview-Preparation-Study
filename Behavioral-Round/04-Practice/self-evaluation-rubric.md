## Mirror Practice Guide

### Why Mirror Practice Works

Practicing in front of a mirror forces you to:
- Notice your facial expressions
- See your hand gestures
- Become aware of nervous habits
- Practice making "eye contact" (with yourself)
- Feel what the interviewer sees

### Mirror Practice Protocol

1. **Setup:** Stand or sit in front of a mirror at interview distance (3-4 feet)
2. **Timer:** Set a timer for 3 minutes per question
3. **Delivery:** Answer the question as if the mirror is the interviewer
4. **Watch for:**
   - Do you make eye contact (with your reflection)?
   - Do you fidget, touch your face, play with your hair?
   - Do you smile at appropriate moments?
   - Do you gesture naturally or too much?
   - Does your expression match your words? (Concerned when discussing problems, enthusiastic when discussing wins)
5. **After each answer:** Score yourself on delivery (separate from content)

### Mirror Practice Delivery Scorecard

| Criterion | Score (1-5) |
|---|---|
| Eye contact | |
| Facial expressions match content | |
| Hand gestures are natural | |
| No nervous habits (fidgeting, etc.) | |
| Voice pace is appropriate | |
| Posture is confident | |
| Pauses are comfortable, not awkward | |

## Recording and Review Tips

### How to Record

- Use your phone's camera in selfie mode
- Or use your laptop's webcam (Zoom recording, QuickTime, etc.)
- Position the camera at eye level (same as a video interview)
- Record in a quiet environment

### What to Watch For When Reviewing

**Content Review (first pass, audio only):**
- [ ] Did you follow STAR structure?
- [ ] Did you include specific "I" actions?
- [ ] Did you give quantifiable results?
- [ ] Were there any tangents or filler?
- [ ] Was the answer 2-3 minutes?

**Delivery Review (second pass, video):**
- [ ] Did you make eye contact with the camera?
- [ ] Were your facial expressions appropriate?
- [ ] Were your gestures natural?
- [ ] Did you speak at a good pace?
- [ ] Did you show confidence without arrogance?

**Filler Word Count:**
Track how many times you say:
- "Um" / "Uh": ___
- "Like": ___
- "You know": ___
- "So" (as a filler): ___
- "Basically": ___
- "Actually": ___

**Goal: Under 3 filler words per answer.**

### How to Reduce Filler Words

1. Replace filler words with silence (pause instead of "um")
2. Slow down your speaking pace by 10%
3. Practice the first sentence of each story until it flows without fillers
4. Record yourself 3 times in a row -- fillers decrease with each take

## Common Pitfalls Checklist

Before your interview, verify you are NOT making any of these mistakes.

### Story Content Pitfalls

- [ ] **No "I" statements.** Your actions are buried in "we" language. Fix: Identify 3-5 specific things YOU did.

- [ ] **No metrics.** Results are vague ("it went well"). Fix: Add at least 2 specific numbers to every result.

- [ ] **The humble-brag failure.** Your failure story is actually a success story in disguise ("I worked too hard"). Fix: Choose a REAL failure with real negative consequences.

- [ ] **The blame game.** You subtly blame others for problems. Fix: Own your part explicitly, even if others contributed.

- [ ] **The ancient story.** All your stories are from 5+ years ago. Fix: Find at least 4 stories from the last 2-3 years.

- [ ] **The one-trick pony.** You use the same story for every question. Fix: Prepare 8 distinct stories covering different competencies.

- [ ] **No complications.** Every story goes smoothly from start to finish. Fix: Include a complication and how you adapted (shows resilience).

- [ ] **Missing the "why."** You describe what you did but not why you chose that approach. Fix: Add reasoning to each action step.

### Delivery Pitfalls

- [ ] **Rambling.** Answers consistently exceed 4 minutes. Fix: Practice with a timer. Cut context, sharpen results.

- [ ] **Too brief.** Answers are under 90 seconds. Fix: Add more action steps and reasoning.

- [ ] **Monotone.** Your voice does not vary in pace, pitch, or volume. Fix: Practice emphasizing key words and pausing for effect.

- [ ] **Filler word overload.** More than 5 filler words per answer. Fix: Practice replacing fillers with silence.

- [ ] **Script mode.** You sound like you memorized your answer. Fix: Practice saying the same story differently each time. Know the KEY POINTS, not the exact words.

- [ ] **No emotion.** Your stories are delivered like a news report. Fix: Show genuine emotion -- enthusiasm for wins, concern for problems, reflection for failures.

- [ ] **Starting with "Great question."** Interviewers hear this 50 times a day. Fix: Start directly with your situation.

### Mindset Pitfalls

- [ ] **Perfectionism.** You refuse to share any story where you were not perfect. Fix: Interviewers WANT to see you are human. Include failures and mistakes.

- [ ] **Comparison mode.** You worry your stories are not impressive enough compared to other candidates. Fix: Authenticity beats impressiveness. A genuine small story beats a fabricated big one.

- [ ] **Over-preparation.** You have memorized every word and sound robotic. Fix: Know your stories as bullet points, not scripts. Let the natural language vary.

- [ ] **Under-preparation.** You think you can "wing it" because you have real experience. Fix: Even great experiences sound terrible without structure. Prepare.

## Final Pre-Interview Checklist

### The Night Before

- [ ] Review your 8 story titles (not full stories) as mental triggers
- [ ] Review the company's values one more time
- [ ] Prepare your "Tell me about yourself" answer
- [ ] Prepare your "Why this company?" answer
- [ ] Prepare 3-5 questions to ask the interviewer
- [ ] Lay out clothes / set up video call space
- [ ] Get 7-8 hours of sleep

### 1 Hour Before

- [ ] Review your story titles one final time
- [ ] Do a 5-minute warmup: say "Tell me about yourself" aloud
- [ ] Take 3 deep breaths
- [ ] Smile at yourself in the mirror
- [ ] Remind yourself: you KNOW your stories. Trust your preparation.
- [ ] Have water nearby
- [ ] Silence your phone

### During the Interview

- [ ] Pause 2-3 seconds before answering each question
- [ ] Start with the Situation, not "Great question!"
- [ ] Use "I" for your actions, "we" for team outcomes
- [ ] Include at least one metric in every answer
- [ ] If you lose your place, say "Let me make sure I address your question..."
- [ ] Save time for YOUR questions at the end

### Remember

```
You are not trying to be perfect.
You are trying to be genuine, clear, and prepared.
The interviewer wants you to succeed.
Trust your stories. Trust your preparation. Be yourself.
```
