## How Amazon Behavioral Interviews Work

### Structure
- You will have 1-2 dedicated behavioral rounds (45-60 minutes each)
- EVERY interview round (including coding) starts with 10-15 minutes of behavioral questions
- Each interviewer is assigned 2-3 specific LPs to evaluate
- They will ask follow-up questions to dig deeper ("Tell me more about...", "What specifically did YOU do?", "Give me another example...")

### What Interviewers Write Down
Amazon interviewers take detailed notes using this format:
```
LP: [Leadership Principle being evaluated]
Question: [What they asked]
Situation: [Your situation in 1-2 sentences]
Action: [Your specific actions -- they focus heavily here]
Result: [Quantifiable outcome]
Rating: Strongly Demonstrated / Demonstrated / Not Demonstrated
```

### Scoring
- Each LP is rated independently
- You need "Demonstrated" or "Strongly Demonstrated" on most LPs
- One "Not Demonstrated" on a critical LP can sink your candidacy
- The Bar Raiser has veto power based on behavioral assessment

### Critical Amazon Rule: "Dive Deep" on Follow-ups
Amazon interviewers are trained to ask "Tell me more" and "What specifically did you do?" repeatedly. They will keep digging until they reach the real YOU or until they discover you are padding the story. Prepare 3 levels of depth for each story.

## The 16 Leadership Principles

---

### 1. Customer Obsession

> "Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers."

#### What Amazon Wants to Hear
- You made a decision that prioritized the customer even when it was costly or difficult
- You gathered customer feedback or data to drive decisions
- You thought about the customer experience before revenue or internal convenience
- You pushed back on something that would hurt customers

#### Sample Questions
1. "Tell me about a time you went above and beyond for a customer."
2. "Describe a time when you had to balance customer needs with business constraints."
3. "Tell me about a time you used customer feedback to drive a change."

#### STAR Answer Framework
```
Situation: A decision or project where customer impact was at stake
Task: You needed to [deliver/decide/change] something affecting customers
Action:
  - You gathered customer data/feedback FIRST
  - You advocated for the customer-centric approach
  - You made a trade-off in favor of the customer
  - You measured customer impact
Result: Customer metric improved (NPS, retention, satisfaction, adoption)
```

#### Red Flags to Avoid
- Talking about customers in abstract/theoretical terms
- Not having specific customer metrics
- Prioritizing internal convenience over customer experience
- Describing a situation where you SHOULD have thought about customers but did not

---

### 2. Ownership

> "Leaders are owners. They think long term and don't sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say 'that's not my job.'"

#### What Amazon Wants to Hear
- You took responsibility for something outside your defined scope
- You thought about long-term impact, not just the immediate fix
- You did not pass the buck or wait for someone else to act
- You treated the company's resources as your own

#### Sample Questions
1. "Tell me about a time you took ownership of something that was not your responsibility."
2. "Describe a time you identified a problem outside your area and fixed it."
3. "Tell me about a time you had to think long-term rather than optimizing for the short term."

#### STAR Answer Framework
```
Situation: Something was broken/needed improvement outside your direct scope
Task: No one owned it / it was falling through the cracks
Action:
  - You noticed the problem proactively
  - You took it upon yourself to investigate and fix
  - You considered the long-term implications
  - You did not wait to be asked or assigned
Result: Problem resolved + lasting impact beyond just your team
```

#### Red Flags to Avoid
- "That was not my team's responsibility" (instant disqualifier)
- Only fixing symptoms, not root causes
- Short-term thinking that creates tech debt
- Waiting for permission to act

---

### 3. Invent and Simplify

> "Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams, and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by 'not invented here.'"

#### What Amazon Wants to Hear
- You came up with a novel solution to a problem
- You simplified a complex process or system
- You were open to ideas from outside your team/company
- You challenged the status quo and found a better way

#### Sample Questions
1. "Tell me about a time you came up with a creative solution."
2. "Describe a time you simplified a complex process."
3. "Tell me about an innovative idea you proposed and implemented."

#### STAR Answer Framework
```
Situation: A complex problem or inefficient process
Task: Needed a solution that did not exist / process was too complicated
Action:
  - You identified the core problem (not just symptoms)
  - You researched/brainstormed novel approaches
  - You proposed a simpler or more innovative solution
  - You implemented and iterated on it
Result: Measurable improvement in simplicity, efficiency, or capability
```

#### Red Flags to Avoid
- "We did it this way because it was how it was always done"
- Over-engineering a solution (the opposite of simplify)
- Not being open to others' ideas
- Innovation without measurable impact

---

### 4. Are Right, A Lot

> "Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs."

#### What Amazon Wants to Hear
- You made a correct judgment call when others disagreed
- You sought out dissenting opinions before making a decision
- You used data AND intuition to make good decisions
- You were willing to change your mind when presented with new evidence

#### Sample Questions
1. "Tell me about a time you made a tough call that turned out to be right."
2. "Describe a time you sought out a perspective different from your own."
3. "Tell me about a decision where you had to rely on your judgment rather than data."

#### STAR Answer Framework
```
Situation: A decision with significant stakes and differing opinions
Task: You needed to make a judgment call
Action:
  - You gathered multiple perspectives
  - You challenged your own assumptions
  - You made a decision with reasoning
  - You took responsibility for the outcome
Result: The decision proved correct / the outcome validated your judgment
```

#### Red Flags to Avoid
- "I was right and everyone else was wrong" (arrogant)
- Not seeking diverse perspectives
- Inability to describe your reasoning process
- Never admitting to being wrong

---

### 5. Learn and Be Curious

> "Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them."

#### What Amazon Wants to Hear
- You actively sought out new knowledge or skills
- You were curious about something outside your domain
- You applied learning from one area to another
- You invested in your own growth without being asked

#### Sample Questions

3. "Tell me about a time you had to learn something quickly to solve a problem."

#### STAR Answer Framework
```

Task: You needed to learn [skill/domain/technology] to [deliver/solve/improve]
Action:
  - You took initiative to learn (did not wait for training)
  - You used specific methods (reading, prototyping, asking experts)

---

### 7. Insist on the Highest Standards

```

#### Red Flags to Avoid
- Reckless action without any analysis
- Waiting for perfect information when speed matters
- Not distinguishing between one-way and two-way door decisions
- Being unable to make decisions

---

### 10. Frugality

---

### 13. Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit

## Story Mapping Strategy

### Map Your 8 Stories to Amazon's LPs

| Story | Primary LP | Secondary LP | Tertiary LP |
|---|---|---|---|
| Story 1 | | | |
| Story 2 | | | |
| Story 3 | | | |
| Story 4 | | | |
| Story 5 | | | |
| Story 6 | | | |
| Story 7 | | | |
| Story 8 | | | |

### Coverage Check

Verify you have at least one story for each LP:

- [ ] Customer Obsession
- [ ] Ownership
- [ ] Invent and Simplify
- [ ] Are Right, A Lot
- [ ] Learn and Be Curious
- [ ] Hire and Develop the Best
- [ ] Insist on the Highest Standards
- [ ] Think Big
- [ ] Bias for Action
- [ ] Frugality
- [ ] Earn Trust
- [ ] Dive Deep
- [ ] Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit
- [ ] Deliver Results
- [ ] Strive to be Earth's Best Employer
- [ ] Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility

### Priority LPs (Most Frequently Tested)

Based on interview data, these LPs are tested most frequently:

```
Tier 1 (Almost Always): Customer Obsession, Ownership, Deliver Results,
                          Earn Trust, Dive Deep
Tier 2 (Very Common):    Bias for Action, Have Backbone, Insist on Highest
                          Standards, Learn and Be Curious
Tier 3 (Common):         Invent and Simplify, Think Big, Are Right A Lot,
                          Hire and Develop
Tier 4 (Less Common):    Frugality, Best Employer, Broad Responsibility
```

**Minimum preparation:** Have strong stories for all Tier 1 and Tier 2 LPs. Tier 3 and 4 can sometimes be covered by adapting Tier 1/2 stories.

## The Bar Raiser Round

### What Is a Bar Raiser?

- A specially trained Amazon interviewer who is NOT on the hiring team
- Their job is to ensure every new hire RAISES the bar for the company
- They have VETO power over the hiring decision
- They typically conduct one of the behavioral rounds

### What Makes the Bar Raiser Different

1. **They go deeper.** Expect 3-4 follow-up questions per story.
2. **They probe for inconsistencies.** If your story does not add up, they will find out.
3. **They evaluate across LPs.** Even if assigned specific LPs, they assess your overall LP fit.
4. **They are experienced.** Most have done 100+ interviews. Rehearsed answers are obvious to them.

### How to Prepare for the Bar Raiser

- Have DEEP knowledge of each story (3 levels of detail)
- Be honest -- they can tell when you are fabricating
- Prepare for "And then what happened?" follow-ups
- Have multiple stories per LP (they may reject your first story)
- Practice with someone who asks tough follow-up questions

---

## Amazon-Specific Tips

### The Amazon Interview Loop

```
Round 1: Coding + Behavioral (15 min behavioral, 45 min coding)
Round 2: System Design + Behavioral (15 min behavioral, 45 min design)
Round 3: Behavioral (full 45-60 min, often the Bar Raiser)
Round 4: Behavioral + Hiring Manager (45-60 min)
```

### Do's

- Use LP language in your answers: "I took ownership..." / "I dove deep..."
- Start each answer with the situation, not "Great question!"
- Have 2+ stories per LP (they may say "Give me another example")
- Include metrics in EVERY answer
- Mention customer impact whenever relevant

### Do Not's

- Do not name competitors by name (say "a competitor" instead)
- Do not trash previous employers
- Do not use stories that make Amazon look bad (if you worked there before)
- Do not use the exact same story for multiple interviewers (they compare notes)
- Do not say "we" when you mean "I"

### "Tell Me About Another Time..."

Amazon interviewers frequently ask for a SECOND example. This happens when:
1. Your first answer was weak (they are giving you another chance)
2. They want to see the LP across multiple contexts
3. They want to compare your behavior across situations

**Always have 2 stories prepared for each Tier 1 and Tier 2 LP.**

### Post-Interview: The Debrief

After your interview loop, ALL interviewers meet to discuss:
- Each interviewer presents their LP evaluations
- The Bar Raiser facilitates and has veto power
- They look for consistency across your stories
- They evaluate if you raise the bar for the role level

**What this means for you:** Be consistent in who you are across all rounds. Do not present different personalities to different interviewers.
