## One Week Before

### Logistics
- [ ] Confirm interview date, time, and timezone
- [ ] Confirm format: virtual or in-person
- [ ] For virtual: Get the video link (Zoom, Google Meet, etc.)
- [ ] For in-person: Know the exact address, floor, and room
- [ ] Know who you are meeting (names and roles if possible)
- [ ] Know the schedule (how many rounds, what types, how long)
- [ ] Have recruiter's email and phone number saved

### Preparation
- [ ] Complete company research (see [Company Research Guide](../02-Company-Research/how-to-research-companies.md))
- [ ] Review 3-5 blog posts from the company's engineering blog
- [ ] Prepare your "Why this company?" answer (specific, researched)
- [ ] Polish your "Tell me about yourself" pitch (2 minutes)
- [ ] Review your 5-7 STAR stories (one more pass)
- [ ] Do a final mock interview (coding or behavioral)
- [ ] Review your one-page cheat sheet (key patterns, complexity reference)

### Practice
- [ ] Solve 2-3 medium problems per day (maintain sharpness)
- [ ] Practice coding in Google Docs or CoderPad (not your IDE)
- [ ] Time yourself: 25-30 minutes per medium problem

---

## The Night Before

### Setup
- [ ] **Laptop charged**, camera working, internet stable (virtual interviews)
- [ ] Test your microphone and speakers/headphones
- [ ] Test screen sharing works
- [ ] Close unnecessary browser tabs and applications
- [ ] Disable desktop notifications (Slack, email, etc.)

- [ ] **Outfit ready**: Smart casual for tech (clean shirt, no wrinkles)
  - Virtual: At minimum, dress professionally from the waist up
  - In-person: Business casual (no suit needed for tech)

### Review (30 minutes max, then STOP)
- [ ] Review the company's core values/principles one more time
- [ ] Re-read your STAR stories once (do not over-rehearse)
- [ ] Glance at your coding pattern cheat sheet
- [ ] Review the specific interview format for this company

### Wind Down
- [ ] Stop studying by 9 PM -- your brain needs rest, not more cramming
- [ ] Prepare water bottle and snacks (nuts, fruit, granola bars)
- [ ] Set TWO alarms (phone + backup)
- [ ] **Get 7-8 hours of sleep** -- this is non-negotiable
- [ ] Avoid alcohol, heavy food, and excessive caffeine

---

## Morning Of

### Physical Preparation
- [ ] Wake up at least 2 hours before the interview
- [ ] Light exercise or a 15-minute walk (reduces anxiety, improves focus)
- [ ] Shower and dress (even for virtual -- it puts you in "performance mode")
- [ ] Eat a good breakfast: protein + complex carbs (eggs, oatmeal, toast)
  - Avoid: Heavy meals, excessive sugar, anything that makes you sluggish
- [ ] Drink water. Stay hydrated throughout the day.
- [ ] Moderate caffeine (if you normally drink coffee, have your usual amount)

### Mental Preparation
- [ ] Review your one-page cheat sheet (key patterns, not full notes)
- [ ] Read your "Tell me about yourself" pitch once
- [ ] Do a quick warm-up: Solve one easy problem (5-10 minutes) to activate your brain
- [ ] Positive self-talk: "I have prepared. I know this material. I will do my best."
- [ ] Deep breathing: 4 counts in, 7 counts hold, 8 counts out (repeat 3x)

### Technical Setup (Virtual)
- [ ] Test your setup 30 minutes before the interview
- [ ] Video: Camera on, good lighting (face the window, not away from it)
- [ ] Audio: Test microphone, use headphones to avoid echo
- [ ] Background: Clean, neutral background (or use a blur filter)
- [ ] Screen: Close all irrelevant apps, have only the interview tools open
- [ ] Backup: Phone charged and ready as backup camera/audio
- [ ] Join the call 5 minutes early

### In-Person Logistics
- [ ] Leave early enough to arrive 10-15 minutes before your slot
- [ ] Bring: Photo ID, phone, charger, pen, and a notepad
- [ ] Have the recruiter's phone number in case you are late
- [ ] Know where the office is (do a dry run if possible)

## During the Interview

### For Every Round

**First 2 Minutes**:
- [ ] Smile and introduce yourself (even virtually)
- [ ] "Hi, I'm [Name]. Nice to meet you. I'm really excited to be here."
- [ ] Small talk is fine (30 seconds): weather, how their day is going

**Coding Rounds**:
- [ ] Read the problem carefully. Read it TWICE.
- [ ] Ask 3-5 clarifying questions before writing any code:
  - "What is the expected input size?"
  - "Can the input be empty or null?"
  - "Should I handle duplicate values?"
  - "Is the input sorted?"
  - "What should I return if there is no valid answer?"
- [ ] Discuss your approach BEFORE coding. Get interviewer buy-in.
- [ ] State time and space complexity of your approach upfront.
- [ ] **Think out loud** the entire time. Never code in silence for more than 30 seconds.
- [ ] Write clean code with meaningful variable names (not `i`, `j`, `temp`).
- [ ] Test your solution with the given example(s).
- [ ] Test with edge cases (empty input, single element, large input).
- [ ] If stuck: "Let me step back and think about this differently..."
- [ ] If you see a bug: "I notice a potential issue here, let me fix it."

**System Design Rounds**:
- [ ] Start with requirements (functional + non-functional)
- [ ] Do back-of-envelope estimation (QPS, storage, bandwidth)
- [ ] Draw a clear high-level diagram
- [ ] Talk through the data flow for the main use case
- [ ] Deep dive into 1-2 critical components
- [ ] Discuss trade-offs for every major decision
- [ ] Mention monitoring, alerting, and failure handling

**Behavioral Rounds**:
- [ ] Use STAR format for every answer
- [ ] Be SPECIFIC: names, dates, numbers, outcomes
- [ ] Focus 60% on the Action (what YOU did, not the team)
- [ ] Always end with a measurable Result
- [ ] Show self-awareness: "If I did it again, I would..."
- [ ] Keep answers to 2-3 minutes (not 5+)

**Last 5 Minutes of Every Round**:
- [ ] Ask "Do you have any questions for me?" (see question list below)
- [ ] Thank the interviewer: "Thanks for your time. I really enjoyed this discussion."

### Key Do's and Don'ts

| DO | DO NOT |
|----|--------|
| Think out loud | Code in silence |
| Ask clarifying questions | Assume the problem constraints |
| Discuss trade-offs | Present only one approach |
| Test your code | Say "I think it works" without testing |
| Admit when you do not know something | Fake knowledge |
| Ask for hints when truly stuck | Give up or panic |
| Stay positive after a hard round | Carry negativity into the next round |

---

## Between Rounds (Onsite)

If you have multiple rounds in one day:

- [ ] Take 2-3 deep breaths between rounds
- [ ] Drink water, eat a snack if there is a break
- [ ] Use the bathroom if needed (do not wait)
- [ ] **Do NOT dwell on the previous round** -- it is done
- [ ] Mentally reset: "Clean slate. Fresh start."
- [ ] Review your notes for the next round type (30 seconds)
- [ ] Stretch if you can (sitting for hours hurts performance)

### Lunch with the Team

If there is a lunch break with team members:
- [ ] Be friendly and engaged (yes, you are still being evaluated informally)
- [ ] Ask questions about the team culture and projects
- [ ] Do NOT ask about salary, hours, or PTO during lunch
- [ ] Do NOT complain about any round or interviewer
- [ ] Be yourself -- they are evaluating culture fit

---

## After the Interview

### Same Day

- [ ] **Send a thank-you email within 24 hours** (to the recruiter, cc: hiring manager if appropriate)

## Questions to Ask Your Interviewer

Asking great questions shows genuine interest and helps YOU evaluate the company.
Pick 2-3 per round (do not ask all of them).

### About the Team (Best for Engineers / Hiring Manager)
1. "What does a typical day look like for someone in this role?"
2. "How is the team structured? How many engineers, PMs, designers?"
3. "What is the team's biggest technical challenge right now?"
4. "How are decisions made on the team? (Top-down? Consensus? Tech lead?)"
5. "What does the on-call rotation look like?"

### About the Technology (Best for Engineers)
6. "What is the tech stack for this team?"
7. "How do you handle technical debt? Is there dedicated time for it?"
8. "What does the CI/CD pipeline look like? How often do you deploy?"
9. "What is the testing strategy? (Unit, integration, e2e?)"
10. "Are there any major migrations or re-architectures planned?"

### About Growth (Best for Hiring Manager)
11. "What does career growth look like here? How are promotions decided?"
12. "How often are performance reviews conducted?"
13. "What resources are available for learning and development?"
14. "What has the career trajectory looked like for recent hires in this role?"
15. "What does success look like in the first 6 months?"

### About Company Culture (Best for Anyone)
16. "What do you personally enjoy most about working here?"
17. "What is the work-life balance like on this team?"
18. "How does the team handle disagreements on technical decisions?"
19. "Is there flexibility for remote work?"
20. "What is one thing you would change about the company?"

### Questions to Avoid
- "What does the company do?" (Shows you did not research)
- "How much vacation do I get?" (Save for recruiter)
- "When can I get promoted?" (Sounds entitled)
- "Did I get the job?" (Puts them on the spot)
- "I don't have any questions." (NEVER say this)

---

## Emergency Situations

### Internet Goes Down (Virtual Interview)
1. Immediately call/text the recruiter: "My internet dropped. Switching to mobile hotspot."
2. Switch to phone hotspot
3. If video is unstable, offer to do audio-only: "My video is unstable, is audio-only okay?"
4. Most companies are understanding -- this happens regularly

### You Go Blank on a Problem
1. Take a breath: "Let me take a moment to think about this."
2. Re-read the problem from the beginning
3. Start with what you DO know: "I know this involves [pattern]..."
4. Ask for a hint: "Could you give me a small nudge on the direction?"
5. Start with brute force: "Let me start with the simplest approach and optimize."

### You Are Running Late (In-Person)
1. Call or text the recruiter immediately (do not wait until you arrive)
2. Apologize briefly, do not over-explain
3. "I'm running about 10 minutes late due to traffic. I apologize and am on my way."

### You Realize You Made a Mistake in a Previous Round
1. Do NOT bring it up in the next round
2. Do NOT email the interviewer to "correct" your answer
3. Let it go. One round does not define the outcome.

### You Feel Overwhelmed or Anxious
1. Ask for a 30-second break: "Could I take a moment to collect my thoughts?"
2. Deep breath: 4 in, 7 hold, 8 out
3. Remember: The interviewer wants you to succeed
4. Focus on the next 5 minutes, not the final outcome
