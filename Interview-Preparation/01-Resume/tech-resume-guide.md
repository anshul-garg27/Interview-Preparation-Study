## Resume Format & Layout

### The Non-Negotiable Rules

1. **One page. Always.** Even if you have 15 years of experience. Recruiters spend
   6 seconds per resume. One page forces you to include only what matters.

2. **No photos.** US/UK companies do not want photos. It introduces bias and some
   ATS systems reject resumes with images.

3. **No fancy graphics, charts, or columns.** ATS systems cannot parse multi-column
   layouts, graphics, or tables. Keep it clean and linear.

4. **Clean, ATS-friendly format.** Use a standard template. No headers/footers
   (ATS ignores them). No text boxes.

5. **Font**: Calibri, Arial, Roboto, or Helvetica at 10-11pt. Body text should
   never be smaller than 10pt.

6. **Margins**: 0.5 to 0.75 inches on all sides.

7. **File Format**: PDF (preserves formatting). Name it `FirstName_LastName_Resume.pdf`.

8. **Consistent formatting**: If one job title is bold, ALL job titles must be bold.
   If one date is right-aligned, ALL dates must be right-aligned.

### Section Order

For **experienced engineers** (2+ years):
```
1. Header (Name + Contact)
2. Experience
3. Skills
4. Education
5. [Optional] Certifications
```

For **new grads / early career** (< 2 years):
```
1. Header (Name + Contact)
2. Education
3. Projects
4. Experience (internships)
5. Skills
```

---

## Section-by-Section Guide

### 1. Header

**Include**:
- Full Name (larger font, 14-16pt)
- Phone Number
- Professional Email (firstname.lastname@gmail.com, NOT coolgamer99@yahoo.com)
- LinkedIn URL (customized: linkedin.com/in/firstname-lastname)
- GitHub URL (if you have meaningful repos)
- Portfolio/Website (if applicable)

**DO NOT Include**:
- Home address (nobody mails you anything)
- Age or date of birth
- Marital status
- Photo
- "References available upon request" (obviously)

**Example**:
```
ANSHUL GARG
(555) 123-4567 | anshul.garg@gmail.com | linkedin.com/in/anshulgarg | github.com/anshulgarg
```

### 2. Summary (Optional)

Only include a summary if you have 3+ years of experience AND it adds value.
New grads should skip this section entirely.

**Format**: 2 lines maximum. Include: years of experience, specialization, key
achievement or scale.

**Good Example**:
```
Senior Software Engineer with 6 years of experience building high-throughput
distributed systems at Amazon and Stripe. Led the redesign of payment processing
pipeline handling $2B+ in annual transactions.
```

**Bad Example**:
```
Passionate and motivated software engineer seeking a challenging position where
I can utilize my skills and grow professionally.
```
(This says nothing specific. Every candidate could write this.)

### 3. Experience (Most Important Section)

This section determines whether you get an interview or not. For each role:

**Format**:
```
Company Name — Job Title                              Start Date – End Date
Location (or Remote)

• [Action Verb] + [What you did] + [Technology] + [Quantifiable Result]
• [Action Verb] + [What you did] + [Technology] + [Quantifiable Result]
• [Action Verb] + [What you did] + [Technology] + [Quantifiable Result]
```

**Rules**:
- 3-4 bullet points per role (5 max for most recent role)
- Most recent role gets the most space
- Use past tense for previous roles, present tense for current role
- Every bullet MUST have a quantifiable result
- Start every bullet with a strong action verb (see list below)

**Excellent Bullet Point Examples**:

```
• Designed and implemented a real-time notification system using Apache Kafka
  and Redis, reducing notification latency from 30s to 500ms (94% improvement)
  and supporting 5M daily active users.

• Led migration of monolithic REST API to 12 microservices using Spring Boot
  and Kubernetes, reducing deployment time from 4 hours to 15 minutes and
  enabling independent team deployments.

• Optimized PostgreSQL database queries by implementing composite indexes,
  query restructuring, and connection pooling, improving p99 latency from
  2s to 200ms for the product catalog service.

• Architected a distributed caching layer using Redis Cluster, reducing
  database load by 60% and saving $150K/year in infrastructure costs.

• Built an automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions and Terraform,
  reducing release cycle from bi-weekly to daily and cutting deployment
  failures by 80%.

• Developed a fraud detection system using Python and scikit-learn that
  identified $2M in fraudulent transactions in the first quarter,
  achieving 95% precision at 87% recall.

• Mentored 4 junior engineers through structured code reviews and
  weekly 1-on-1s, resulting in 2 promotions within 12 months.
```

**Bad Bullet Point Examples** (and why they fail):

```
BAD: "Worked on backend services"
WHY: No specifics, no tech, no impact. What did you actually do?

BAD: "Responsible for maintaining the codebase"
WHY: Passive voice ("responsible for"), no action, no result.

BAD: "Used Java and Spring Boot"
WHY: This is a skill, not an achievement. What did you BUILD with Java?

BAD: "Helped the team with various tasks"
WHY: Vague. What tasks? What was the outcome?

BAD: "Improved system performance"
WHY: By how much? From what to what? Be specific.
```

### 4. Skills Section

**Format**: Group by category, list in order of proficiency.

```
Languages:    Python, Java, Go, JavaScript/TypeScript, SQL
Frameworks:   Spring Boot, Django, React, Node.js, FastAPI
Databases:    PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, DynamoDB, Elasticsearch
Cloud/DevOps: AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, SQS), Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD
Tools:        Kafka, RabbitMQ, gRPC, GraphQL, REST APIs
```

**Rules**:
- Tier 1 (list first): Technologies you use daily and can discuss in depth
- Tier 2 (list second): Technologies you have used in projects
- DO NOT list: Git, VS Code, Jira, Slack, Linux (too basic, expected of everyone)
- DO NOT list technologies you cannot discuss in an interview
- Match keywords from the job description

### 5. Education

**Format**:
```
University Name — Degree                                    Graduation Year
  GPA: X.X/4.0 (only if > 3.5)
  Relevant Coursework: [only if new grad]
```

**Rules**:
- Include GPA only if > 3.5 (or top of class)
- New grads: include relevant coursework (Data Structures, Algorithms, OS, DBMS)
- Experienced engineers: just degree + university + year. One line.
- DO NOT include high school

### 6. Projects (For New Grads / Early Career)

If you have < 2 years of experience, projects replace work experience as your
primary showcase.

**Format** (same as experience):
```
Project Name | Technologies Used                             Date
• [What you built] + [How it works] + [Scale/Impact]
• [Technical challenge] + [How you solved it] + [Result]
```

**Good Example**:
```
Real-Time Chat Application | React, Node.js, Socket.io, MongoDB    Jan 2025
• Built a real-time messaging platform supporting 1000+ concurrent users
  with WebSocket-based communication and message persistence in MongoDB.
• Implemented end-to-end encryption using AES-256, ensuring secure
  communication between users.
• Deployed on AWS EC2 with auto-scaling, maintaining 99.9% uptime
  during load testing with 5000 simulated users.
```

## The XYZ Formula for Bullet Points

Every bullet point should follow this formula:

```
Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y], by doing [Z]
```

Or in resume format:

```
[Action Verb] + [What you did (Z)] + [Using what tech] + [Resulting in (X measured by Y)]
```

### Examples Using the XYZ Formula

| X (Result) | Y (Metric) | Z (What You Did) | Full Bullet |
|------------|------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Reduced latency | from 2s to 200ms | Optimized database queries | Optimized PostgreSQL queries using composite indexes, reducing p99 latency from 2s to 200ms |
| Increased throughput | by 300% | Built caching layer | Designed Redis caching layer handling 50K requests/sec, increasing API throughput by 300% |
| Saved costs | $150K/year | Migrated infrastructure | Migrated from on-premise to AWS, reducing infrastructure costs by $150K/year |
| Improved reliability | from 95% to 99.99% | Implemented retry + circuit breaker | Implemented circuit breaker pattern with exponential retry, improving service reliability from 95% to 99.99% |

### Numbers You Can Quantify

If you think "I don't have metrics," think harder. Here are things you can measure:

- **Performance**: Latency reduction (ms), throughput increase (req/sec), load time
- **Scale**: Users served, requests handled, data processed (GB/TB)
- **Cost**: Infrastructure savings ($), developer time saved (hours/week)
- **Quality**: Bug reduction (%), test coverage increase, incident reduction
- **Speed**: Deployment time, release frequency, development velocity
- **People**: Team size led, engineers mentored, reviews conducted
- **Business**: Revenue impact, conversion improvement, user engagement

If you truly cannot find a number, use relative terms: "significant reduction,"
"2x improvement," "across 3 teams." But always try for a real number first.

## ATS Optimization

ATS (Applicant Tracking System) is software that scans resumes before a human
sees them. If your resume is not ATS-friendly, it goes straight to the reject pile.

### How ATS Works

1. ATS parses your resume into structured data (name, email, experience, skills)
2. It scores your resume against the job description (keyword matching)
3. Resumes scoring below the threshold are auto-rejected
4. Only top-scoring resumes reach a human recruiter

### ATS Optimization Rules

**1. Use Standard Section Headers**
```
GOOD: "Experience", "Education", "Skills", "Projects"
BAD:  "Where I've Worked", "My Journey", "Tech Toolbox"
```

**2. Use Keywords from the Job Description**

If the JD says "microservices," your resume should say "microservices" (not
"distributed services" or "service-oriented architecture"). Use EXACT keywords.

**3. Avoid These Formatting Pitfalls**:
- No tables (ATS cannot parse them)
- No text boxes or graphics
- No headers/footers (ATS ignores them)
- No multi-column layouts
- No images, icons, or logos
- No fancy bullet characters (use standard bullet •)

**4. Submit as PDF** (unless they specifically ask for .docx)

**5. Include the Job Title** somewhere in your resume, ideally in your summary
or most recent title.

### Keyword Matching Strategy

For each job application:
1. Copy the job description into a text file
2. Highlight all technical skills, tools, and buzzwords
3. Ensure your resume contains 80%+ of those keywords
4. Use the EXACT same phrasing (not synonyms)

**Example**:
```
JD says: "Experience with AWS services including EC2, S3, and Lambda"
Resume: "Deployed applications on AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, SQS, CloudWatch)"
                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ exact match
```

## Common Resume Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Two or More Pages
No one reads page 2. If your resume is 2 pages, you have not edited enough.
Cut old roles to 2 bullets. Remove outdated skills. Trim project descriptions.

### Mistake 2: Listing Responsibilities Instead of Achievements
```
BAD:  "Responsible for backend development"
GOOD: "Built a payment processing API handling $50M monthly transactions"
```

### Mistake 3: No Numbers
Every bullet should answer "how much?" or "how many?" If you cannot quantify,
you have not thought hard enough about your impact.

### Mistake 4: Listing Every Technology You Have Ever Touched
Your resume is not a skills dump. Only list technologies you can discuss
confidently in an interview. If you used MongoDB once in a tutorial,
do not list it.

### Mistake 5: Using a "Creative" Template
Fancy templates with sidebars, infographics, and color schemes look great
on Dribbble. They look terrible to an ATS. Use a clean, simple template.

### Mistake 6: Including Irrelevant Experience
Your summer job at a coffee shop is irrelevant unless you built their
ordering system. Keep only tech-relevant experience.

### Mistake 7: Not Tailoring for Each Application
One generic resume for all applications means you match no job description
well. Spend 15 minutes customizing keywords for each application.

### Mistake 8: Typos and Grammar Errors
One typo can get your resume rejected. Run spell check. Have a friend read it.
Use Grammarly. Read it out loud.

## Resume for Different Experience Levels

### New Graduate (0-1 years)

**Strategy**: Lead with education and projects. Your projects ARE your experience.

**Section Order**: Header > Education > Projects (3-4) > Internships > Skills

**Tips**:
- Include GPA if > 3.5
- List relevant coursework
- Personal projects count -- make them substantial
- Hackathon projects are great material
- Open source contributions stand out

### Early Career (1-3 years)

**Strategy**: Your first 1-2 jobs are the focus. Projects become secondary.

**Section Order**: Header > Experience > Skills > Projects (1-2) > Education

**Tips**:
- Lead with your job, not your degree
- Start removing academic projects as work experience grows
- Focus on impact, not just what you did
- Start highlighting leadership (mentoring, code reviews, on-call)

### Mid-Career (3-7 years)

**Strategy**: Depth of impact. Show increasing responsibility and scope.

**Section Order**: Header > Summary (optional) > Experience > Skills > Education

**Tips**:
- Summary becomes useful here (2 lines max)
- Show progression: IC -> Tech Lead, small scope -> large scope
- Highlight cross-team collaboration and system-level thinking
- Remove all academic projects and coursework
- Trim early career roles to 2 bullets

### Senior / Staff (7+ years)

**Strategy**: Breadth of influence. Show you operate beyond your immediate team.

**Section Order**: Header > Summary > Experience > Skills > Education (1 line)

**Tips**:
- Summary should highlight your specialization and scale
- Focus on: architecture decisions, mentoring, org-level impact
- Only include last 3-4 roles (most relevant)
- Older roles get 1-2 bullets max
- Highlight: tech strategy, system design, cross-org collaboration
