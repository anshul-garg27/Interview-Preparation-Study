## Understanding Total Compensation

Total Compensation (TC) is the complete financial package you receive each year.
It is NOT just your base salary.

```
TC = Base Salary + Annual Bonus + Stock/RSUs + Sign-on Bonus (amortized)
```

### Component Breakdown

| Component | What It Is | Typical % of TC | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|-------|
| **Base Salary** | Fixed monthly pay | 40-60% | Taxed as regular income |
| **Annual Bonus** | Performance-based cash | 5-20% | Usually 10-15% of base; not guaranteed |
| **Stock/RSUs** | Company shares that vest over time | 20-50% | Vest over 4 years; value fluctuates |
| **Sign-on Bonus** | One-time cash at joining | 0-15% | Typically Year 1 only; may have clawback |

### How RSUs Work

RSU = Restricted Stock Unit. You receive shares that "vest" (become yours) over time.

**Standard Vesting Schedule (Most Companies)**:
```
Year 1: 25%
Year 2: 25%
Year 3: 25%
Year 4: 25%
```

**Amazon's Unique Vesting** (heavily back-loaded):
```
Year 1: 5%
Year 2: 15%
Year 3: 40%
Year 4: 40%
```
Amazon compensates with higher sign-on bonus in Years 1-2.

**Key Point**: RSU value is tied to stock price. If the stock drops 30%, your TC
drops significantly. If it rises 30%, you get a raise without asking.

### Example TC Breakdown

For a Senior SDE at a big tech company with $400K TC:
```
Base Salary:   $200,000 (50%)
Annual Bonus:   $30,000 (7.5%, ~15% of base)
RSUs/Year:     $150,000 (37.5%, from a $600K/4yr grant)
Sign-on Bonus:  $20,000 (5%, Year 1 only)
─────────────────────────
Total Year 1:  $400,000
```

## Salary Ranges by Level

### 2026 Total Compensation Estimates (USD)

These are total compensation ranges (base + bonus + stock), not just base salary.

## The Psychology of Negotiation

Understanding the psychology behind negotiation is critical. Here are the key principles:

### Principle 1: The Company EXPECTS You to Negotiate

The first offer is never the best offer. Recruiters have a "range" for every level,
and the first offer is typically in the lower half. They BUDGET for negotiation.

**The math**: If a company's range for L5 is $350K-$500K and they offer you $400K,
they already have approval to go to $450K+ for the right candidate.

### Principle 2: Anchoring Effect

The first number mentioned in a negotiation becomes the "anchor." Everything is
compared to it. This is why you should NEVER give a number first.

If you say "I'm looking for $200K base" and they were willing to pay $230K,
you just lost $30K.

### Principle 3: You Have More Leverage Than You Think

Once a company extends an offer, they have invested 20-40 hours of interview time
and weeks of process. They do NOT want to start over. You have significant leverage
at this stage.

### Principle 4: Negotiation Does NOT Rescind Offers

In 15+ years of industry experience, offer rescissions due to professional negotiation
are essentially unheard of at reputable companies. The worst that happens is they say
"this is our best offer." That is a fine outcome.

### Principle 5: Be Collaborative, Not Adversarial

Frame negotiation as "How can we make this work for both of us?" not "Give me more
money." You are about to join this team. Start the relationship positively.

---

## Negotiation Tactics

### Tactic 1: Never Give a Number First

When asked about salary expectations:

```
Recruiter: "What are your salary expectations?"

YOU: "I'd prefer to learn more about the role, the team, and the total
compensation structure before discussing specific numbers. I'm confident
we can find something that works for both of us."
```

If they push harder:

```
Recruiter: "We need a number to move forward."

YOU: "I'm open to a competitive offer that reflects the scope of the role
and my experience. What range does this position fall in?"
```

If they REALLY push (some companies require it):

```
YOU: "Based on my research on levels.fyi and Glassdoor, I understand the
market range for this level is [X]-[Y]. I'd expect something within that
range, but I'm most interested in the overall opportunity."
```

### Tactic 2: Always Negotiate (Even If the Offer Seems Good)

Even if the initial offer exceeds your expectations, negotiate. You do not know
what you do not know. The company may have room to offer 15-20% more.

### Tactic 3: Use Competing Offers

The strongest negotiation tool is a competing offer. Companies are far more
responsive when they know they might lose you.

```
"I'm very excited about [Your Company], and it's my top choice. However,
I also have an offer from [Competitor] at [TC amount]. Is there room to
bring the offer closer to match?"
```

### Tactic 4: Negotiate Multiple Components

If they say base salary is capped, negotiate other components:
- More RSUs
- Higher sign-on bonus
- Faster vesting schedule
- Remote work flexibility
- Extra vacation days
- Relocation budget
- Learning/conference budget
- Team or project choice
- Start date flexibility
- Title adjustment

### Tactic 5: Express Enthusiasm + Ask for More

Always pair your ask with genuine enthusiasm:

```
"I'm genuinely excited about this role and the team. The work on [specific
project] is exactly what I want to do. I'd love to make this work. Would
it be possible to [specific ask]?"
```

### Tactic 6: Use Silence

After making your ask, stop talking. Let the recruiter respond. Silence is
uncomfortable, and the person who speaks first often concedes.

### Tactic 7: Get It in Writing

Verbal agreements are not binding. Always ask for the updated offer in writing
before accepting.

---

## Word-for-Word Scripts

### Script 1: Receiving the Initial Offer

```
Recruiter: "We'd like to offer you the SDE-2 position at $350K TC.
That's $180K base, $30K bonus target, and $560K in RSUs over 4 years."

YOU: "Thank you so much for the offer. I'm really excited about the
opportunity to work with the team on [specific project]. I'd like to
take a couple of days to review the full details. Could you send me
the written offer letter? I want to give this the careful consideration
it deserves."

[PAUSE -- review the offer, do your research, wait 2-3 days]
```

**Key Rules**:
- NEVER accept on the spot, even if it is amazing
- Thank them and express excitement
- Ask for 3-5 business days to review
- Ask for the written offer (not just verbal)

### Script 2: Asking for More (No Competing Offer)

```
YOU: "Thanks again for the offer. I've had a chance to review it, and
I'm very excited about joining the team. I do have a few questions
about the compensation.

Based on my research and conversations with others at similar levels,
I was expecting the total compensation to be closer to $400K. Given
my [X years of experience] and [specific relevant achievement], would
there be room to adjust the base salary to $195K and increase the
RSU grant to $680K over 4 years?"
```

### Script 3: Leveraging a Competing Offer

```
YOU: "I really appreciate the offer and I'm very excited about the
role. I want to be transparent -- I also have an offer from [Company]
at $420K total compensation. [Your Company] is genuinely my first
choice because of [specific reason]. Would it be possible to bring
the total compensation closer to match? I want to make this work."
```

### Script 4: When They Say "This Is Our Best Offer"

```
Recruiter: "Unfortunately, this is the best we can do on base salary."

YOU: "I understand base salary may be fixed. Are there other components
we could adjust? For example:
- A higher sign-on bonus to bridge the gap?
- An increase in the RSU grant?
- Additional vacation days?
- A guaranteed performance review at 6 months for potential adjustment?"
```

### Script 5: Accepting the Offer

```
YOU: "Thank you for working with me on this. I'm thrilled to accept
the offer. Could you send me the updated offer letter reflecting
[specific agreed changes]? I'd like to review and sign it.

Also, I wanted to confirm:
- Start date: [Date]
- Team: [Team Name]
- Location: [Office/Remote]
- Reporting to: [Manager Name]

I'm really looking forward to joining."
```

### Script 6: Declining an Offer Gracefully

```
YOU: "Thank you so much for the offer and for the time you and the
team invested in the interview process. After careful consideration,
I've decided to accept another opportunity that better aligns with
my current career goals.

I really enjoyed meeting [interviewer names] and learning about the
work your team is doing on [project]. I hope our paths cross again
in the future."
```

## Leveraging Competing Offers

### The Ideal Scenario: Multiple Offers

The strongest negotiation position is having 2-3 offers simultaneously.
Here is how to engineer this:

1. **Apply to companies in clusters** (within the same 2-week window)
2. **Coordinate timelines**: When one company moves fast, tell others
   "I have a deadline approaching, can we accelerate?"
3. **Use each offer to negotiate the others up**:
   ```
   Company A offers $350K → Tell Company B
   Company B offers $380K → Tell Company A
   Company A increases to $400K → Tell Company B
   Company B increases to $410K → Accept (or go back to A)
   ```

### What If You Only Have One Offer?

You can still negotiate effectively:
- Use market data (levels.fyi) as your benchmark
- Emphasize your unique skills and experience
- Show that you are excited but need the offer to reflect the market

### How to Communicate Competing Offers

DO:
- Be honest about having another offer
- Share the TC number (not a breakdown)
- Express genuine preference for the company you are negotiating with

DO NOT:
- Lie about having an offer you do not have (this can backfire catastrophically)
- Share the other company's offer letter
- Use aggressive ultimatums ("Match this or I walk")
- Play more than 2-3 rounds of back-and-forth (it gets tiresome)

## Beyond Base Salary

When base salary is maxed out, here are other things to negotiate:

| Component | Typical Range | Negotiation Difficulty |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| Sign-on Bonus | $10K-100K | Easy |
| RSU Grant Increase | 10-30% more shares | Medium |
| Annual Bonus Target | 5-25% of base | Hard (usually fixed by level) |
| Start Date | Flexible | Easy |
| Remote Work | Full/hybrid | Medium (depends on policy) |
| Relocation Package | $5K-50K | Easy |
| Extra Vacation | 1-2 extra weeks | Medium |
| Conference Budget | $2K-10K/year | Easy |
| Learning Budget | $1K-5K/year | Easy |
| Title | Senior vs. Staff | Hard (but try) |
| Team/Project Choice | Preferred team | Medium |
| Guaranteed Review | 6-month performance review | Easy |
| Equipment Budget | Laptop, monitors, chair | Easy |

### Priority Order for Negotiation

1. **RSUs** (highest long-term value, often most flexible)
2. **Sign-on Bonus** (companies have more room here than in base)
3. **Base Salary** (try, but this is often the most rigid)
4. **Remote/Hybrid** (huge quality of life impact)
5. **Start Date** (more time to prepare, or earlier start = earlier vesting)
6. **Everything Else** (vacation, title, relocation, etc.)

## Red Flags in Offers

### Red Flag 1: Exploding Deadlines

```
"You need to accept by Friday or the offer expires."
```

**Reality**: Most companies will extend the deadline if you ask. If they refuse,
it is a sign of a culture that values pressure over respect. Request 1-2 more weeks.

```
"I'm very interested and want to make a thoughtful decision. Could I have
until [date, 1-2 weeks out] to finalize?"
```

### Red Flag 2: "We Don't Negotiate"

```
"Our offers are non-negotiable."
```

**Reality**: This is almost never true. Even "standardized" comp companies
(like some startups with published bands) have flexibility on sign-on, equity,
level, and other components. Always ask.

### Red Flag 3: Heavily Back-Loaded RSUs

If most of the equity vests in Years 3-4 (Amazon-style), the company is betting
you will stay long enough to earn it. Many people leave before Year 3.
Calculate your Year 1 and Year 2 TC separately to see the real picture.

### Red Flag 4: Verbal Offer with No Written Follow-Up

If a company makes a verbal offer but delays the written offer, something may
be wrong. Always request written confirmation within 1 week.

### Red Flag 5: Lowball Offer with "Growth Potential"

```
"The base is lower, but there's huge growth potential."
```

**Reality**: Growth potential is speculative. Base salary is real. Do not accept
below-market compensation for vague promises. If they believe in your growth,
include a guaranteed 6-month review with specific promotion criteria.

### Red Flag 6: Offer Contingent on Unreasonable Terms

Watch for:
- Non-compete clauses (check enforceability in your state)
- Clawback clauses on sign-on bonus (typically 1 year is standard; 2+ years is aggressive)
- Intellectual property assignment broader than work-related output
- Mandatory arbitration clauses

---

## Startup Equity Negotiation

Startup equity is fundamentally different from big tech RSUs.

### Key Differences

| Aspect | Big Tech RSUs | Startup Equity |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Liquidity | Immediately sellable | Cannot sell until IPO/acquisition |
| Valuation | Market price, transparent | Company sets price, opaque |
| Risk | Low (established company) | High (90% of startups fail) |
| Upside | Moderate (2-5x over 4 years if lucky) | Potentially massive (10-100x) or zero |
| Tax | Taxed at vest | Complex (ISOs vs NSOs, AMT, 83(b)) |

### Questions to Ask About Startup Equity

1. **How many shares are outstanding?** (Your percentage matters, not # of shares)
2. **What is the current 409A valuation?** (Fair market value per share)
3. **What is the latest preferred price?** (What investors paid)
4. **What is the liquidation preference?** (Investors may get paid before you)
5. **What is the vesting schedule?** (Standard: 4 years with 1-year cliff)
6. **Are these ISOs or NSOs?** (Tax implications differ significantly)
7. **What happens to my equity if I leave?** (Exercise window: 90 days vs extended)
8. **Is there an 83(b) election option?** (For early-exercise stock options)

### How to Value Startup Equity

**Conservative approach** (recommended):

```
Value of equity = (Number of shares * 409A valuation) * 0.2

The 0.2 multiplier accounts for:
- Risk of company failing
- Potential dilution from future funding
- Lack of liquidity
- Time value of money
```

**Translation**: If a startup offers you 10,000 shares at a $10 409A valuation,
their "value" is $100K. But conservatively, treat it as $20K for negotiation
purposes. Supplement with higher base salary.

---

## Timeline Management

### How to Coordinate Multiple Interview Processes

```
Week 1:  Apply to 10-15 companies (mix of top choices and warm-ups)
Week 2-4: Phone screens and OAs
Week 5-8: Onsites (try to schedule top choices later for more practice)
Week 8-10: Offers start arriving

Key: When you get your first offer, immediately tell all other companies:
"I have a deadline approaching. Can we accelerate the process?"
```

### Managing Offer Deadlines

| Situation | What to Do |
|-----------|-----------|
| Offer deadline in 1 week, waiting on other companies | Ask for extension: "Could I have until [date]?" |
| Two offers, different deadlines | Accelerate the slower one, ask extension on the faster one |
| Dream company interview next week, have offer now | Accept the current offer (you can renege, though it is not ideal) |
| No other offers | Negotiate based on market data, then accept or decline |

### Typical Timelines by Company

| Company | Application to Offer | Negotiation Time |
|---------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Google | 6-12 weeks | 1-2 weeks |
| Amazon | 4-8 weeks | 1 week |
| Meta | 4-6 weeks | 1-2 weeks |
| Microsoft | 4-8 weeks | 1-2 weeks |
| Startups | 2-4 weeks | 1 week |

---

## After You Accept

### First 30 Days After Accepting

1. **Send thank-you notes** to your interviewers and recruiter
2. **Complete all onboarding paperwork** promptly
3. **Set up your equipment** and development environment
4. **Connect with your future manager** on LinkedIn
5. **Ask your manager**: "What should I read or prepare before Day 1?"
6. **Negotiate your start date** if needed (more rest = better Day 1)

### If You Need to Renege on an Accepted Offer

This should be a last resort, but sometimes a significantly better offer comes
after you have already accepted somewhere else.

```
"I want to be upfront and honest with you. After accepting the offer, I
received an unexpected opportunity that I feel I cannot pass up. I apologize
for the inconvenience and truly appreciate the time and effort your team
invested in me. I hope we can maintain a positive relationship for the future."
```

**Note**: Reneging burns a bridge. The recruiter and interviewers will remember.
Only do this if the difference is substantial and career-defining.

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Always negotiate.** The first offer is never the best offer.
2. **Never give a number first.** Let them anchor.
3. **Use competing offers.** They are the strongest leverage.
4. **Be enthusiastic AND firm.** You can be both.
5. **Negotiate beyond base.** RSUs, sign-on, remote work, and vacation are all on the table.
6. **Get everything in writing.** Verbal promises mean nothing.
7. **The worst they can say is no.** Offers are virtually never rescinded for professional negotiation.
8. **Invest 30 minutes in negotiation.** It can be worth $30K-$100K+.

This is the most profitable 30-minute conversation of your life. Prepare for
it with the same intensity you prepare for the technical interview.
