> Never walk into an interview without knowing the company inside out.
> Interviewers can tell the difference between someone who Googled them
> 5 minutes ago and someone who genuinely understands their product,
> culture, and technical challenges.

## Why Company Research Matters

1. **It shows genuine interest.** Interviewers ask "Why do you want to work here?"
   in every single interview. A specific, informed answer beats "I think it's a
   great company" every time.

2. **It helps you ask better questions.** "What's your tech stack?" shows you did not
   research. "I saw you migrated from PostgreSQL to DynamoDB last year -- what drove
   that decision?" shows you did.

3. **It helps YOU decide.** You are evaluating the company as much as they are
   evaluating you. Research helps you spot red flags early.

4. **It improves your system design answers.** Knowing the company's scale, products,
   and technical constraints helps you give more relevant design answers.

## The 7-Point Research Framework

Before any interview, research these 7 areas:

### 1. Product & Users

**Questions to Answer**:
- What does the company build? (Core product)
- Who are the users? (B2B? B2C? Developers? Enterprise?)
- How does the company make money? (Revenue model)
- What are the key product metrics? (DAU, revenue, market share)
- Who are the main competitors?

**Where to Find**:
- Company website (About page, Product pages)
- Wikipedia for public company overview
- Crunchbase for startup info (funding, valuation)
- App stores for user ratings and reviews

### 2. Tech Stack

**Questions to Answer**:
- What programming languages are primarily used?
- What frameworks and libraries?
- What databases? (SQL, NoSQL, both?)
- What cloud provider? (AWS, GCP, Azure?)
- What infrastructure tools? (Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform?)
- What CI/CD pipeline?

**Where to Find**:
- Engineering blog (best source)
- Job descriptions (they list required technologies)
- StackShare.io (tech stacks of companies)
- GitHub repos (if open source)
- Conference talks by their engineers

### 3. Engineering Blog

**Questions to Answer**:
- What technical challenges are they solving?
- What is their engineering culture like?
- What technologies are they investing in?
- What scale do they operate at?

**Where to Find**:
- `[company name] engineering blog` on Google
- Medium publications (many companies post on Medium)
- Dev.to articles by their engineers

**What to Read**: The 3-5 most recent posts. Note any recurring themes
(e.g., focus on reliability, ML, developer tooling).

### 4. Culture & Values

**Questions to Answer**:
- What are the company's stated values?
- What is the engineering culture like? (Move fast? Careful? Autonomous?)
- What is the work-life balance reputation?

**How to Read Glassdoor Reviews**:
- Sort by "Most Recent" (old reviews may be outdated)
- Filter by department if possible (Engineering vs Sales culture differs)
- Look for patterns, not individual complaints
- If everyone mentions the same problem, it is real

### 5. Recent News

**Questions to Answer**:

### 6. Interview Format

**Questions to Answer**:

- What types of rounds? (Coding, system design, behavioral, machine coding?)
- What is the timeline (application to offer)?
- What platform do they use for coding? (CoderPad, HackerRank, Google Docs?)
- Are there any unique rounds? (Bar Raiser, take-home, presentation?)

**Where to Find**:
- Glassdoor Interview section (best source)
- LeetCode Discuss (company-tagged experiences)
- Blind (anonymous interview experiences)
- TeamBlind.com
- YouTube: "[company name] interview experience"

### 7. The Team

**Questions to Answer**:
- Who is the hiring manager?

- How big is the team?
- What is the team's recent output?

**Where to Find**:
- LinkedIn (search employees at that company in your target role)
- GitHub (team members' profiles)
- Ask the recruiter: "Can you tell me about the team I'd be joining?"
- Company org charts (sometimes public)

## How to Use Research in Interviews

### In "Why Do You Want to Work Here?"

**Generic (BAD)**:
"Google is a great company and I'd love to work there."

**Informed (GOOD)**:
"I've been following Google's work on Spanner and the Zanzibar authorization system.
The challenge of building globally consistent databases at Google's scale is exactly
the kind of distributed systems problem I want to spend my career on. I also read
your recent blog post on how the Ads team uses ML to optimize bidding, and that
intersection of systems engineering and ML is fascinating to me."

### In System Design Rounds

If you know the company uses Kafka, you can say: "Given that your system already
uses Kafka for event streaming, I'd propose using it here for order events..."

This shows you understand their ecosystem, not just theoretical systems.

### In "Do You Have Questions for Me?"

**Generic (BAD)**:
"What's the team size?"

**Informed (GOOD)**:
"I read your blog post about migrating from a monolith to microservices. How far
along is that migration, and what has been the biggest unexpected challenge?"

### In Behavioral Rounds

Research the company's values and weave them in:
- Amazon: Tie your stories to Leadership Principles
- Google: Show "Googleyness" (intellectual curiosity, collaboration)
- Meta: Show "Move Fast" and "Be Bold"
- Microsoft: Show "Growth Mindset"

## Company-Specific Research Tips

### For FAANG / Big Tech
- Read the engineering blog extensively (they publish a lot)
- Watch conference talks by their engineers (InfoQ, Strange Loop)
- Research the specific team you are applying to
- Know the company's interview quirks (Amazon LP, Google Hiring Committee)

### For Startups
- Understand their funding stage and runway
- Read the founders' backgrounds (LinkedIn, Twitter)
- Understand the market they are targeting
- Check if they are profitable or burning cash
- Ask about equity: vesting schedule, strike price, valuation

### For Mid-Size Companies
- Often less public info available; lean on Glassdoor and Blind
- Ask the recruiter more questions to fill gaps
- Look for former employees' LinkedIn posts about their experience

## Red Flags to Watch For

During your research, watch for these warning signs:

| Red Flag | What It Might Mean |
|----------|-------------------|
| High Glassdoor turnover reviews | Poor management or culture |
| No engineering blog or public tech presence | May not value engineering |
| Job posting has been open for 6+ months | Role may be underfunded or hard to fill |
| Vague job description ("do everything") | Unclear role, may be overworked |
| Recent rounds of layoffs | Financial instability |
| CEO has multiple controversies | Cultural issues from the top |
| "We're like a family" in job posting | Blurred boundaries, possible overwork |
| No mention of work-life balance | It may not exist there |
| Very high salary for the role | Could be a high-stress, high-churn role |
| Recruiters being pushy about timeline | May be desperate or disorganized |

Research is not just about impressing the interviewer. It is about protecting yourself
from joining the wrong company. An informed decision now saves you from job-hopping
in 6 months.

## Final Thought

Spending 1-2 hours researching a company before an interview is one of the highest-ROI
activities in your job search. It costs nothing, takes little time, and dramatically
improves your interview performance and your ability to make good career decisions.

Do the research. Every time. No shortcuts.
